## 🛑 STOP: Read This Before You Do Anything Else

> ### 1️⃣ Read the whole `README.md` first
> The `README.md` in this repository contains the full instructions: class descriptions, feature specifications, question prompts and the video script. **If you skip it, you will lose marks.**
>
> ### 2️⃣ Understand the full code before answering any question
> Open `SchedulerSimulation.java` and read it **from top to bottom**. You must be able to explain what `Process`, `run()`, `runToCompletion()`, `addProcessToQueue()`, `Thread.start()`, `Thread.join()` and `Thread.sleep()` do **before** you write a single answer in Parts B and C. Run the program at least once and watch the output.
>
> ### 3️⃣ Commit many times, not once
> A single commit, or all commits made in the last hour, costs you **-0.5 mark**. See the [Commit Rules](#-commit-rules-mandatory) below.

**How to use this file:**
1. Fill in your **Student Information** (below) right now.
2. Follow the steps in the **Work Roadmap** in order.
3. Update the **Development Log** *every time* you work on the assignment, not at the end.
4. Do not delete any section header. Replace the `[...]` placeholders with your own text.

## 🔁 Commit Rules (MANDATORY)

> ### ⚠️ MANY COMMITS ARE REQUIRED. A single bulk commit is penalized (-0.5 mark).

**Minimum: 3 meaningful commits. Aim for 6 or more.**

| # | Commit | Example message |
|:-:|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Student ID set | `Set my student ID: 441234567` |
| 2 | Feature 1: Priority | `Feature 1: Added priority field to Process class` |
| 3 | Feature 2: Context switches | `Feature 2: Implemented context switch counter` |
| 4 | Feature 3: Waiting time | `Feature 3: Added waiting time tracking and summary table` |
| 5 | Development log entries | `Docs: Added development log entries 1-3` |
| 6 | Reflection and answers | `Docs: Completed reflection and technical answers` |
| 7 | Video link | `Docs: Added demo video link` |

**Rules:**
- ✅ **One commit per feature.** Do not put all three features in one commit.
- ✅ **Commit after each work session**, and after each part of this file.
- ✅ **Spread your commits over different dates.** Not all in one day.
- ❌ **Do not make all commits in the last hour** before the deadline.
- ❌ **No vague messages** like `done`, `update` or `final version`.

> 💡 **TIP:** Your commit history is checked and you **show it in your video** (at least 3 commits visible). Your development log dates should match your commit dates.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** **Use VS Code** (see *Recommended Development Environment* in `README.md` for the full setup). Sign in to GitHub in VS Code, then commit from the Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G) → stage → write a message → Commit → Sync/Push. You can edit and commit this file the same way. **Pushing** matters: commits that are not pushed to GitHub are invisible to the instructor.

# Part A: Development Log (0.5 mark)

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Minimum **5 entries**, spread over **different dates**. Five entries written on the same day, or written all at once at the end, will lose marks and look like a copy. Entry dates should be **between the start of the assignment and the deadline (October 10, 2026)**.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Write an entry at the **end of each work session**, while you still remember what happened. It takes 5 minutes.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Be specific. "Worked on the code" is a weak entry. "Added a `static int contextSwitches` counter and incremented it before `currentThread.start()`" is a strong one.
>
> 📌 **NOTE:** Each entry needs: date and time, what you did, details, challenges, solution, and time spent. Real challenges are fine (and expected). Do not invent fake ones.

## Example Entry (do not copy it, write your own)

### Entry 1 - [September 22, 2026, 2:30 PM]

## Your Development Log

### Entry 1 - [October 8,2026, 7:45 PM]
**What I did** : Updated my student ID in SchedlerSimulation.java.

**Details** : I changed the student ID in the code so the simulation uses my ID to generate random valus.

**Challenges**: I needed to find the correct place to update the ID

**Solution**: I found the studentID variable and replaced its value with my ID.

**Time spent**:October 6, 10:00 PM

---

### Entry 2 - [Date and Time]
**What I did**:Added process priority to the simulation.

**Details**:I added a random priority from 1 to 10 for each process and displayed it when the process enters the ready queue.

**Challenges**: I had some errors while editing the java code.

**Solution**:I fixed the code errors and ran the program to check that the priorities appeared correctly.

**Time spent**:October 6,10:10 PM

---

### Entry 3 - [Date and Time]
**What I did**:Added a context switch counter to the simulation.

**Details**:I created a static counter and increased it each time a process started running.I also displayed the total number of context switches at the end of the simulation,

**Challenges**:I needed to find the correct place to increase the counter.

**Solution**: I added the counter before currentThread.start() and tested the program to make sure the total appeared correctly.

**Time spent**: October 7,11:00 PM

---

### Entry 4 - [Date and Time]
**What I did**:aedded waiting time tracking to the simulatoin.

**Details**:I used system.currentTimeMillis() to calculate how long each process waited in the ready queue.I also calculated the turaraound time by adding the waiting time and burst time.

**Challenges**:I had some errors while adding the waiting time variables and displaying the results.

**Solution**:I fixed the errors and added a final table showing the process name,burst,time,waiting time,and turnaraound time.

**Time spent**:October 8,9:00 PM

---

### Entry 5 - [Date and Time]
**What I did**:Tested the simulation and checked the final results.

**Details**:I ran the java program to make sure the process priority, context switch counter,waiting times,and turnaround times were displayed correctly.

**Challenges**: Some process appeared more than once in the final table, and I had some java code errors.

**Solution**:I uesd LinkedHashSet to remove duplicate process form the final table.I fixed the errors and ran the program again to check the results.

**Time spent**:October 8,10:00 PM

# Part B: Reflection (0.5 mark)

> 🛑 **STOP:** Do **not** start this part until you have read the `README.md`, read the **entire** `SchedulerSimulation.java`, run it, and finished the three features.
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Each answer must be **5 to 7 sentences**, in **your own words**. Copied or AI-generated answers without understanding get **0 marks for the whole assignment**. You may be asked to explain them in person.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Mention concrete things you actually did: a method you wrote, an error you hit, a line of output you saw. Generic answers score low.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Draft your answer in a few bullet points first, then turn them into sentences.

## Question 1: What did you learn about multithreading?

> 💡 **TIP:** Talk about thread creation (`Runnable`, `Thread.start()`), waiting with `Thread.join()`, simulating work with `Thread.sleep()`, and what surprised you.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[I learned that multithreading allows a program to work with multiple threads. In this assignment, I used Runnable to define what each process should do. I learned that Thread.start() is used to start a thread. I also understood that Thread.join() makes the program wait for a thread to finish. Thread.sleep() helped me understand how the program simulates execution time. At first, I was confused about how threads work, but after running the code and checking the output, I understood them better.]

## Question 2: What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

> 💡 **TIP:** Pick **one** specific challenge (understanding the code, one of the features, Git, the video) and say *why* it was hard.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[The most challenging part of this assignment was modifying the Java code. At first, I did not understand where to add the new features. I also faced some errors when I changed the code. Sometimes the program did not run because of small mistakes. It was difficult to find the errors and fix them. After trying again and checking the code, I started to understand it better.]

## Question 3: How did you overcome the challenges you faced?

> 💡 **TIP:** Describe your method: reading documentation, adding `System.out.println` to debug, re-reading the README, testing after each small change, asking for help.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[I tried to solve the problems step by step. When I got an error, I checked the code to find the mistake. I also read the instructions again to understand what I needed to do. I tested the program after making changes. When I did not understand something, I asked for help. After fixing the errors, the program worked and I understood the code better.]

## Question 4: How can you apply multithreading concepts in real-world applications?

> 💡 **TIP:** Use real applications you know (web browser, game, mobile app, music player) and connect each one to what you built here.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[Multithreading can be used in many applications we use every day. For example, a web browser can open different tabs at the same time. It can also help mobile apps run tasks without freezing. Music apps can play songs while we use other features. In my assignment, I learned how threads can run different processes. I think multithreading is useful because it makes applications more responsive.]

### Optional: What would you like to learn more about?

[Any topics related to threading or operating systems that you're curious about?]

### Optional: How confident do you feel about multithreading concepts now?

[Beginner / Intermediate / Confident. What do you understand well? What needs more practice?]

### Optional: Feedback on the assignment

[Any comments? Was it helpful? Too easy or hard? Suggestions?]

# Part C: Technical Answers (0.5 mark)

> 🛑 **STOP:** You cannot answer these questions without understanding the code. Re-read `SchedulerSimulation.java` and **run it** first. Your answers must reference **your own code and your own output** (your student ID makes your output unique).
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Each answer must be **3 to 5 sentences**, with specific examples from your code or output. Use correct terms: thread, process, time quantum, ready queue, context switch, burst time.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Keep your program output in a text file or screenshot so you can copy real snippets for Question 2.

## Question 1: Thread vs Process

**Question**: Explain the difference between a **thread** and a **process**. Why did we use threads in this assignment instead of creating separate processes? Mention at least **TWO** specific differences (e.g., memory sharing, creation overhead, communication speed), and reference relevant parts of `SchedulerSimulation.java`.

> 💡 **TIP:** Note that the class named `Process` in our code is a *simulated* process, and it is run by a real Java *thread*. Explain that distinction and point to the `new Thread(process)` line in `addProcessToQueue()`.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[A process is a program that runs and has its own memory. A thread is a smaller part of a process and can share memory with other threads. Threads are faster to create and use less memory than separate processes. In my assignment, the Process class represents a simulated process, and I used new Thread(process) in addProcessToQueue() to create a real Java thread. We used threads because they make it easier to run and manage the simulated processes in the scheduler.]

## Question 2: Ready Queue Behavior

**Question**: In Round-Robin scheduling, what happens when a process doesn't finish within its time quantum? Explain using an example from **your** program output, including **how many times that process was re-queued** before it finished, and explain why re-queueing matters for fairness.

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** The output snippet must come from **your own run** (with your student ID), not from a classmate or from this README.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Pick a process with a large burst time (e.g., more than 2 × time quantum) and count how many "added to ready queue" lines it has after the first one. Search your console for its name (e.g., `P3`).

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[In Round-Robin scheduling, each process gets a time quantum to run. If the process does not finish, it goes back to the ready queue. In my code, addProcessToQueue() is used to add the process again. This gives other processes a chance to run and makes scheduling fair..]

Example from my output:
```
[P3 executing quantum [4000ms]
Remaining time: 655ms
P3 yields CPU for context switch
P3 added to ready queue]
```

**Explanation of example:**
[P3 did not finish during its first time quantum. It had 655ms remaining, so it returned to the end of the ready queue to wait for another turn.]

## Question 3: Thread Lifecycle

**Question**: A thread goes through these states: **New**, **Runnable**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Terminated**. Walk through these states for one process (e.g., P1) from your simulation. For each state, explain **when** P1 enters it and **which line or method call** triggers the transition (`Thread.start()`, `Thread.join()`, `Thread.sleep()`, etc.).

> 💡 **TIP:** Follow P1 through the code: created in `addProcessToQueue()`, started in the scheduler loop, sleeping inside `run()`, and the main thread waiting on `join()`. Remember that **the main thread waits** on `join()`, while **P1's thread sleeps** in `Thread.sleep()`. Be clear about which thread is in which state.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences overall; one short explanation per state)*

1. **New**: [ P1 is in the New state when the thread is created using new Thread(process) in addProcessToQueue().]

2. **Runnable**: [ P1 becomes Runnable when Thread.start() is called and it is ready to run.]

3. **Running**: [P1 becomes Runnable when Thread.start() is called and it is ready to run.]

4. **Waiting**: [The main thread waits for P1 to finish when join() is called. P1 can also sleep using Thread.sleep() while executing.]

5. **Terminated**: [P1 becomes Terminated when its run() method finishes and the thread completes its execution.]

## Question 4: Real-World Applications

**Question**: Give **TWO** real-world examples where Round-Robin scheduling with threads would be useful. **At least one** must be an operating-system-level scenario (e.g., how an OS scheduler shares CPU time among running programs). The second can be any application you choose. For each, explain what the system is and **why Round-Robin fits** (fairness, responsiveness, predictability).

> 💡 **TIP:** Relate each example back to your simulation: what plays the role of the "process", the "time quantum" and the "context switch" in that scenario?

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences per example)*

### Example 1 (operating-system level): [Name of scenario]

**Description**:
[An operating system uses CPU scheduling to run different programs. Each process gets a time quantum to use the CPU. If it does not finish, the CPU switches to another process.]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**:
[Round-Robin is useful because it gives every process a fair chance to run. This is similar to my assignment, where processes return to the ready queue if they still have remaining time. Context switches allow the CPU to move between processes.]

### Example 2: [Name of application/scenario]

**Description**:
[A web server can handle requests from many users at the same time. Each request can be handled by a different thread. The server needs to manage these threads so users do not wait too long.]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**:
[Round-Robin can give each request a fair amount of CPU time. If a request needs more time, it can wait for another turn. This is similar to my assignment, where each process gets a time quantum and the scheduler uses context switches to move between processes]
